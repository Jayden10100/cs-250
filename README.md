# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I can interpret user needs to implement them into a program by first taking the user's requirements and interpreting the functionality of the project I am developing. I can use user stories to help break down the parts of a request to determine how I can develop a functional project. In an Agile environment, user stories offer the basics of the requirements, giving me a starting point. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to the development process would begin as above, by collecting the basic requirements in order to create user stories. From there, I could coordinate meetings to gain more clarification in order to create potential test cases to present to the user. From there, I can begin planning the best development process for delivering the highest quality product.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development effectively communicates. Communication is one of the biggest prinicples highlighted within Agile/Scrum. A good team member acts as one with the team, taking responsibility for their individual contributions to the team, and ensuring they are doing their part to keep productivity high. A good team member exercises good conflict resolution, and open mind, and a willingness to learn.
